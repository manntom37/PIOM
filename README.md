# PIOM
Game Project

Hello! This is the repo for my Topdown Game - a browser based game based off the old Harvest Moon games. 


TO BE COMPLETED -
Demo map
Pixel art files
 - static images for map = boats on jetty, houses, monuments, etc)
 - pixel sprites for characters = playable main character, npcs, Happy the rabbit, etc.
 - 8bit music - Scottish folk, bagpipe, DADGAD? find out how to put music in game!
 
 This game is just a fun way to improve my code and play a game I'd love to play.
